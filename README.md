# Cric-Legends

**Cric-Legends** is a companion app for [KDM Scorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kdm.scorer&hl=en_IN) that uses **PDFPlumber** and **Regex** to automatically extract player performance data from raw match scorecards.

### How It Works

1. Export your match scorecard from **KDM Scorer**.
2. Upload the PDF to this app (or use the [sample scorecard](https://github.com/SPJ27/Cric-legends/blob/main/uploads/1.pdf)).
3. Instantly view **MVP points** and **awards** for every player.

### Sample Players

* Saksham
* Bhavesh
